They say the proof is in the pudding -- or in this case, add-ons. And I have several out in the wild that I'm proud to point to.

    Ansel provides a field type for ExpressionEngine that can have limits, crop ratios, on the fly sizing in template code and much, much more.
- **[Treasury](/software/treasury)**  
    Treasury is an Amazon S3/FTP/SFTP capable file manager for ExpressionEngine 3.
- **[Construct](/software/construct)**  
    Construct provides a friendly page tree structure for navigation and pages in ExpressionEngine. It offers a drag and drop organization interface, friendly and intuitive page creation, well thought through template tags and much more.
