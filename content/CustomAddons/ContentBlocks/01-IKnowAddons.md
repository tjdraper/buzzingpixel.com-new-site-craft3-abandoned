It's one of the things I do and it's something I'm really good at. I know ExpressionEngine and Craft like the back of my hand because I work so much with both systems. And my experience can benefit you.

Maybe you're a front end-developer and don't know anything about that "PHP" stuff. That's perfectly okay. I'm here to help you do what you do best by doing what I do best.

In addition to the add-ons that I've built and sell, I've also built many custom solutions for custom websites -- from inserting custom entry data to integrating members to managing data, I've built nearly every kind of add-on you can imagine.
