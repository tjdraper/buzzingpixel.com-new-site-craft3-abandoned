If you have an existing team and need me to step in and help — or maybe you're a fellow developer and don’t have the time to get it all done — I work well with others. I'm fully supportive of Git version control best practices and how to leverage that in a team environment. And I'm a big advocate of Git-flow.

I've had the privilege of both mentoring, being mentored, and just working with my peers and I love teaming up with great people.

So if you need help, don't be afraid, I can definitely help!
