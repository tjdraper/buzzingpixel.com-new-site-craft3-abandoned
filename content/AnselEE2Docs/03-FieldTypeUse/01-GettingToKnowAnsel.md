Ansel will feel very familiar to use in the publishing workflow because it builds on the basic ExpressionEngine control panel styles. The images in a field use ExpressionEngine's Grid styles and metaphor. Each row in the field is an image. If you have enabled any of the three optional fields, they will show up in the row as well.

There are two options for getting an image into your field:

1. Drag and drop an image to the drop area or click it to select an image to upload
2. Choose an existing image in the file manager (or use the file manager to upload an image)

One of the advantages to using the drag and drop interface is the image will never be uploaded if it does not meet requirements â€” whereas if you go through the file manger interface and upload from there, the image will be uploaded by EE then evaluated by Ansel.
