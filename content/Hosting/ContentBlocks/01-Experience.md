Boy do I have experience. I've worked with nearly every type of hosting environment there is -- and believe me, much of the hosting scene out there is, how can we put this? **not good**.

But over the years, I've gained the experience and developed the right tools, and know the right steps to create a great hosting experience for your ExpressionEngine or Craft based website. No more shared hosting, no more slow response times, no more hassle. When you work with me for your hosting, you get dedicated resources, automated deployments, nightly backups, and more!
