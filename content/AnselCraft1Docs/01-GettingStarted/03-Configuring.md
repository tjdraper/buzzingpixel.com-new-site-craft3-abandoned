### Config file only options

There are a couple of configuration options that can only be set in the config file.

#### optimizerShowErrors

Normally the optimizer for `jpegoptim`, `gifsicle`, and `optipng` will fail silently. However, it can sometimes be useful to know if something is going wrong â€” for instance, when you install the tools on your server and want to make sure they are working. If the optimizer is not able to find the tools or they return an error code when trying to optimize the image, when this config setting is set to true, the optimizer will throw an error for you to see.

`'optimizerShowErrors' => true;`

#### disableOptipng

Disables `optipng` optimization.

`'disableOptipng' => true;`

#### disableJpegoptim

Disables `jpegoptim` optimization.

`'disableJpegoptim' => true;`

#### disableGifsicle

Disables `gifsicle` optimization.

`'disableGifsicle' => true;`

#### forceGD

Forces Ansel to use [GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) image processing for manipulating images. Normally, Ansel will auto-detect if [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) is installed/setup with PHP and use it for manipulating images. If for whatever reason you would like to force Ansel to use GD even though ImageMagick is available, make this setting `true`.

`'forceGD' => true;`
