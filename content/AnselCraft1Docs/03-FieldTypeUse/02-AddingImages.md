    "title": "Adding Images"
}

When you drag and drop an image over the upload area in a field (or choose one from the existing images in the file manager), Ansel will automatically select the largest portion of the image possible given the constraints set up for the field and add an image row.

You can use the re-order handles to the left of a row to change the order of the images in the field.

To change the selected area and/or crop of the image, click the image thumbnail which will bring up the cropping interface with a lasso to select the relevant portion of the image. When you have selected the area of the image you want, click the save button with the green check mark or press the enter key.

If you wish to cancel the crop operation, click the cancel button, or press escape.
