When you need end-user friendly global variables for your sites, Collective makes it easy with a simple and intuitive interface! Collective is a simple system to store early parsed global variables in five different field types: Text Input, Textarea, WYSIWYG, Checkbox, and Simple Grid. You can even use character limiting on the Text Input and Textarea simple field types to keep your clients from doing something they’re not supposed to. The WYSIWYG field comes in handy for those tricky global spots that need a little bit of text formatting but just isn’t the type of content you can put in a channel entry, and the Checkbox field will let you give your users control over various aspects you have designed into the site. And the Simple Grid can be a powerful tool for repeating text fields.
