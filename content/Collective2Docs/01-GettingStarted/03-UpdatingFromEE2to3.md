}

Collective 2 is fully compatible with ExpressionEngine 3. However the Collective 1.x branch which you may have installed on ExpressionEngine 2 is not compatible with ExpressionEngine 3. Updating ExpressionEngine will not affect your Collective variables or data in any way. The ExpressionEngine update instructions include a point where you are encouraged to put any updated add-on files in place before you run the ExpressionEngine updater. For Collective, this has been tested both ways and it doesn't make much of a difference.

Note that after you have updated from EE 2 to 3, if you still have the Collective 1.x version files in place Collective will not appear in the Add-on manager. Don’t be concerned, everything is fine and all your data is safe. Follow the update instructions above and you’ll be good to go.
