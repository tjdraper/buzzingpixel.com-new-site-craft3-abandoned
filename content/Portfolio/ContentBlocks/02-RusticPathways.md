It was my privilege to work with [Cantilever](https://cantilever.co/) to rebuild the Groups and Gap sites for Rustic Pathways. It was a fun and challenging project.

Using a custom front-end build process I put together, both the Groups and the Gap site use one codebase with variables to change brand colors.

It was really fun to put that process together and solve a real maintenance problem going forward. So now, since they share the same design and layout, when things need to be updated or bugs fixed, fixing it on one site fixes it on the other because they come from the same codebase.
