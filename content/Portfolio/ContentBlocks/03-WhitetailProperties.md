Whitetail Properties needed a mobile friendly responsive site with user interaction. During my time as senior developer at Caddis Interactive, I had the privilege of being lead developer on this project.

One of the primary objectives in rebuilding the Whitetail Properties website was to make it easier for users of the site to find the properties they wanted. Meeting this objective started on the home page where you can click on any state to be taken to a listing of properties in that state. And you can further filter by county, price, acreage and more when you get to that page.
