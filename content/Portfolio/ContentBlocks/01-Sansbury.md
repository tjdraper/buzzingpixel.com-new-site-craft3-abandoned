This was such a fun project to work on with [DuBose Web](https://www.duboseweb.com/). What made this website a little more unique was the stationary left panel and scrolling right panels. It works really well and was a challenge I hadn't done before. I was happy to find my JavaScript skills were up to the challenge.
