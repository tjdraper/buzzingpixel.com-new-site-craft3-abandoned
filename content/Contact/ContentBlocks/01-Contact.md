Would you like to hire me to work on a project? Build an add-on? Consult on the best way to get something done? Let's chat. I've got a lot to bring to the table. I have over 10 years of experience with web development and in particular, ExpressionEngine and Craft CMSes. I know how to get things done, and I love delighting clients and paying attention to the details.

If that sounds like something you're interested in, fill out the form and submit it, and we'll get the conversation started!
