Getting your categories to output in a way that makes sense, particularly with nested category structures, can be a daunting task. But not anymore, thanks to Category Construct! The sole reason for Category Construct’s existence is to make your life easier when getting and listing categories!

Like Construct before it, Category Construct has powerful template tags that put you in charge. You can nest to your heart’s content, you can re-use markup, or you can have entirely different markup per-level. Category Construct makes no assumptions.

And like Construct, the `{construct:children}` tag ensures your nested child categories will go right where they are supposed to.
