Installing and updating Ansel for Craft can be done in 1 of 2 ways:

### Composer

For those who are comfortable with and/or prefer the command line, you can install via Composer directly:

```shell
composer require buzzingpixel/ansel-craft
```

After installing via composer, go to your Craft CP > Settings > Plugins and install Ansel.

### Craft Plugin Store

The other way, of course, is through the plugin store.

Use the plugin store in your Craft Control Panel to install Ansel.

### Buying Ansel

Either way, buying and licensing of Ansel for Craft is handled through Craft's plugin store. A site license is $79. Yearly renewals to access updates and support are $29.
