}

Sometimes users and content editors have images that only have a particular point of relevance. Let's face it, most of those folks are not going to know how to use Photoshop, nor should they have to. That's why Ansel provides the wonderful little crop button for every image in a field. Click that magical button, and users can select the portion of the image they want. And of course, all within the developer defined specs.
