Ansel 2 features an intuitive drag and drop interface. Content editors can open Finder (Macintosh) or Explorer (Windows) and drag image right onto the field. If an image does meet a field's specified minimum dimension requirements (if applicable) the image will be rejected.

Additionally, if the user knows the source image they want is already in Craft, they can choose an image from existing files.
