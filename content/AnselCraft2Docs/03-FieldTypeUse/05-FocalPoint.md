Cropping and sizing images is great, but often an image may be used in many different contexts, cropped to different sizes, and more. In order for images to work in the maximum amount of contexts, Ansel works with Craft's native focal point system. Just click the focal point icon and you can set the focal point anywhere on the cropped image. Then in your templates, if you specify dimensions on the Asset that result in cropping, Craft will use the focal point to crop the image.
