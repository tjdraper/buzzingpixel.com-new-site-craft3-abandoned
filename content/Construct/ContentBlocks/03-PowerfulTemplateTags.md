Construct's template tags make no assumptions about your markup, your site structure, or what you want to display in your templates. In true ExpressionEngine style, Construct is purely BYOM (bring your own markup). You determine what your site looks like, not Construct. You write your HTML, Construct does not output any HTML of any kind.

And the `{construct:children}` tag ensures that your nested nodes will be placed exactly where they should be.

Construct puts the power in your hands.
