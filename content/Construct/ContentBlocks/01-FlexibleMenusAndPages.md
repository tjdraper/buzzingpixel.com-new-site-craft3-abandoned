For all of ExpressionEngine's flexibility and powerful content management, there has not traditionally been a good way to manage stand-alone pages or create flexible menu systems that developers and content managers alike can both use with ease. Construct solves both of these problems.

Each Construct node has the option of both routing to a template, and outputting a menu structure in template tags.

Construct can also have multiple trees to fit many different content, page, and menu scenarios. But Construct doesn't stop there.
