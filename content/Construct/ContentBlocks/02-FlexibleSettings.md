Construct's flexible settings allow you to use it strictly for building menus, defining what member groups have access to various trees, and more.

And Construct's master template preferences allow developers to associate ExpressionEngine templates with specific channels so that you can be sure the template chosen will fit the entry fields.

The template preferences also serve the purpose of giving your templates friendlier names so your users won't be confused and so you can use ExpressionEngine's "hidden templates" feature.
