Custom add-ons for ExpressionEngine and Craft CMS are a specialty of mine and I’ve written many add-ons for both systems. Nearly every site I work on ends up with at least one custom add-on to get the job done that needs doing. It’s just one more thing I bring to the table. I’m not afraid to write some PHP as needed.

And if you would like to hire me just for my custom add-on skills rather than a full site build, I’m available! Let’s start the conversation about building the solution you need!
