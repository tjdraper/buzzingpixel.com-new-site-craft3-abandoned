Anyone managing content in ExpressionEngine can now upload any image with the peace of mind that nothing about the design or front end will break in any way. The image constraints have been defined and their image will live within those constraints.

And what if the action of the image they want to use is not in the frame? No problem. Use the crop lasso to select the correct portion of the image!
