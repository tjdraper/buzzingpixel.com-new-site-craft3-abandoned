If you need to store files on a CDN such as Amazon S3, or other SFTP/FTP capable location, Treasury is the solution you need!

Treasury makes setting up your file locations easy. Use any Amazon S3 bucket, use private key authentication for SFTP — whether it’s a key on your server, or a specific key to your location, or use standard FTP.

And if you need to combine Treasury’s file storage engine with the power of [Ansel](/software/ansel-ee), you can do that too! Ansel is fully compatible with Treasury. In fact, with the Treasury API, any developer can make their add-on Treasury compatible.
