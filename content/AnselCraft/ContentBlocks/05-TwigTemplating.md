Templating with Ansel in Craft's Twig templating environment is truly a breeze. Ansel provides the Ansel Image Service to Twig from which any or all images can be retrieved and displayed.

## Ansel and Assets

Ansel saves its images using Craft’s native Assets. And when you work with Ansel images in Twig, everything that’s available to you through an Asset in a Twig template is available to Ansel Images as well.
