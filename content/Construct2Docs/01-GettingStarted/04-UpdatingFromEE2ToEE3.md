Construct 2 is fully compatible with ExpressionEngine 3. However the Construct 1.x branch which you may have installed on ExpressionEngine 2 is not compatible with ExpressionEngine 3. However, updating ExpressionEngine will not affect your Construct trees or data in any way. The ExpressionEngine update instructions include a point where you are encouraged to put any updated add-on files in place before you run the ExpressionEngine updater. However I do not recommend this since Construct 2 is not compatible with versions of ExpressionEngine prior to 3.

After you have updated EE from 2 to 3, then go ahead and put the Construct files in place and run the update in the Control Panel. I do recommend you **make sure to have a database backup** since there are significant schema changes from Construct 1.x to 2.x. While I have tested everything as thoroughly as possible, there is always the possibility of data loss when updating schema.

But if you follow the update instructions above after updating ExpressionEngine 2 to 3, everything should be right as rain.
