Construct Trees are containers for nodes. You may create as many trees as you like. Each tree has settings for what member group has access to it. For instance, you may wish to have a Tree for the main navigation, secondary navigation (perhaps in the footer or something like that), and general site page that are not in any menus.

In short, you can use as many Trees as you like however you like.

On a new installation and/or when there are no Trees in Construct yet, if you are a Super Admin, you will be presented with the option to create a new tree from the Manage Trees section as soon as you visit construct.

Any Trees a member group has access to will appear in the left sidebar. If a non-Super Admin group only has access to one tree, they will not see the sidebar and will only see the tree they have access to.

### Ordering Trees

Trees appear in a specific order in the sidebar. To rearrange the order they appear in, click on "Manage Trees" in the sidebar. Just like with template preferences, you can drag and drop to sort and click save at the bottom of the form to save the order.

### Deleting Trees

As with Template Preferences, if you wish to delete a Tree **and all the Nodes in that Tree**, select the Delete checkbox in the right hand column and click save at the bottom of the form.

<div class="Note">
    <div class="Note__Title">
        Note
    </div>
    <div class="Note__Body">
        <p>Please take note that deleting a Tree deletes all the Nodes in that Tree. <strong>DELETING A TREE AND ITS NODES IS A DESTRUCTIVE ACTION AND IS NOT RECOVERABLE WITHOUT A DATABASE BACKUP</strong>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

### Tree Options

This is the name that will appear to users in the sidebar.

#### Maximum nesting level

This determines how many levels deep a Node may be.

        <p>Routing must be enabled to associate Template with Nodes.</p>
    </div>
</div>
