When routing is enabled in the Construct Settings, there are two ways routing occurs in Construct 2.

1. If the ExpressionEngine URI matches a Node full route
2. If the ExpressionEngine URI matches a route in Construct's routing config.

When a node is matched, the specified template from the Node is served. When a route config is matched, what you have specified for that route will run.
