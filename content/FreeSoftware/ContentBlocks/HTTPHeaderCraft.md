Set various HTTP header properties from your templates.

This is a lot like [Rob Sanchezâ€™s HTTP Header plugin](https://github.com/rsanchez/http_header) for ExpressionEngine. I use that a lot when working with EE and I needed a way to set `application/json` header (among other things) in Craft, so I wrote this Twig Extension.
