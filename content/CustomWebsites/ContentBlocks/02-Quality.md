I don't just cobble a bunch of plugins or themes together, I write every line of HTML and CSS for every site I build. The result is a site that is of the highest caliber and highly performant. You won't have to worry about Google ranking you lower in search results because of site speed issues, and you won't have to worry about a great end-to-end mobile-to-desktop experience. All BuzzingPixel sites are built responsive first. That means they look great on any screen you can put it on.

Revel in the details, delight clients. That's my web development motto.
