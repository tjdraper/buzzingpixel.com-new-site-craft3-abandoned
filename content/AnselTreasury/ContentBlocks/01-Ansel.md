It's an old problem: how can images be constrained to fit any given context, make sure it meets minimum/maximum requirements, and still get the part of the image that's relevant?

Ansel puts you in charge by defining image fields with minimum and/or maximum requirements, aspect ratios, minimum/maximum number of images, and more. This means you don't need to worry if images are the right size &mdash; Ansel makes them the right size.
