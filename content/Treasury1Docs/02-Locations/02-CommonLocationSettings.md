}

There are four settings that are common to each location:

### Name (required)

This is the friendly name of the location and can be anything you want.

### Handle (required)

This is the programatic name for your location. It must be Alpha Dash (alpha plus dashes and underscores).

### Allowed File Types (required)

This lets you determine whether the location should accept all file types or just images.

### Type (required)

The type switcher determines which of the four types this location is. The options are Local, Amazon S3, SFTP, and FTP. As you select from the four different types, the available settings fields will update accordingly.
