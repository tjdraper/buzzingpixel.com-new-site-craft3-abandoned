I am excited (and slightly nervous) to tell you that one of the presentations I submitted to [ExpressionEngine Conference 2016] has been accepted. I will be speaking on Git best practices and how best to leverage Git when using ExpressionEngine. This is a topic I am passionate and excited about. Git is one of the best things that happened to me as a developer and I’ve put a lot of time and effort into learning how best to leverage Git. I also believe in sharing knowledge so I’m very happy to bring the knowledge that I have to a community I truly enjoy being part of.

I also hope that my presentation will bring something for both old and new hands at Git. We can all use some brushing up from time to time, and we can all be reminded of things or encouraged to do things we know we should be doing but aren’t. Even writing this presentation reminded me of some best practices I had let slide.

I really hope you will come to the conference. And not just to hear me, either. There will be [a lot of great presentations] that I am quite looking forward to. And I’m looking forward to catching up with friends I interact with online a lot but rarely see.

And if you [register before September 1st], you’ll get the early bird admission special price!

One other thing: If you’re at the conference, come up and say hi. I make a lot of noise online, but when I don’t know someone, I tend to be standoffish. It’s something about my personality of which I am aware and working on. All the same, it’s good for me to push myself, and good for you to push me.

**And as a special conference promotion, if you come up and say hi to me, and you’re interested, I’ll be glad to give you a copy of the [Ansel + Treasury bundle].** You give me your devot:ee account email and a license with ability to download the bundle will magically appear in your devot:ee account.
